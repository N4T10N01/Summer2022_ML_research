# Summer2022_ML_research
Done mainly in google colab, code is not functional without a google drive to run it off of for the most part. Data for training/test sets can be downloaded to use the code with appropriately modified paths. Code related to servo motors on pi along with pin configurations is trapped on a raspberry pi that unfortunately smoked from running a model from this very project, so the set up for the DeepPiCar cannot be uploaded here.
