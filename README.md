# Summer2022_ML_research
Done mainly in google colab, code is not functional without a google drive to run it off of for the most part. Data for training/test sets can be downloaded to use the code with appropriately modified paths. Code related to servo motors for the miniature car along with pin configurations are trapped on a raspberry pi that unfortunately smoked from running a model from this very project, so the set up for the DeepPiCar cannot be uploaded here.<br />
<br />
IMPORTANT: pre-trained models are too large to upload here but must be worked off of to use code. They can be found here: https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md. Models used were: centernet_mobilenetv2_fpn_od, centernet_resnet50_v1_fpn_512x512_coco17_tpu-8, ssd_mobilenet_v2_fpnlite_320x320_coco17_tpu-8, and ssd_resnet50_v1_fpn_640x640_coco17_tpu-8.
